## About The Project

![App Screenshot](./demo/preview.jpeg)

## Description

This project is for a notes app, which I did to practice using the Context API that ReactJS has and also how to use it alongside Typescript.

The application has a global state that are the notes which are accessed by all the components, they also include the reducers that are to alter the global state when adding and deleting the notes. All of this global state is handled by the Context API.
